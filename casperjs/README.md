README: CasperJS exercises

These are small scripts and HTML/JavaScript files I've used when
testing out small features of [CasperJS][casperweb]. Files with
'_test' in the name should be run with:

    path/to/casperjs test filename

others should just be:

    path/to/casperjs filename

The files in `resources/` should be the same as on my server,
whose URL is coded in the scripts.
